Lazy
====

Chrome extension for the lazy (efficient) people who are tired of typing the same thing over and over!

## How it works

- You type a keyword
- You type the modifier key
- You press space

and the keyword (key in an array) will automatically be converted to the value of that key. 
The functionnement is similar to Emmet for web developpers.
